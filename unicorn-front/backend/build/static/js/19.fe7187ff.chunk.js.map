We spent majority of our childhood years playing the \n                    beautiful game for as long as we remember. However, as we grow up we find our self engaging less in \n                    the activity for various reasons. One reason we discovered was that finding 10 other people who will play\n                    at specific location and scheduled time was inconvenient since most people are living and working in different \n                    environments. Hence, we wanted to solve that problem by creating a service that connects people on demand for \n                    pickup games around their location.\n                    \n                </p>\n                    It is estimated that more than 200 million young adults play football recreationally. However,\n                    after taking to some fellow football enthusiasts we discovered that most people tend to play less\n                    regularly when they grow up.  we wanted to ease that process and make people fall in love with football and other kinds of sports \n                    pick up games again and lead\n                    healthy life style. \n                <p>\n\n                </p>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default AboutUs\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport AboutUs from \"../components/AboutUs\";\nimport Footer from \"../components/Footer.js\";\nimport HeaderWrapped from \"./HeaderWrapped\";\n\nfunction AboutUsPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <HeaderWrapped />\n      <AboutUs />\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default AboutUsPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
