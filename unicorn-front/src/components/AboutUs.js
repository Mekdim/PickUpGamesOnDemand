                <p> We are passionate football(soccer) lovers who loves the games both as a fan and players. We spent majority of our childhood years playing the 
                    beautiful game for as long as we remember. However, as we grow up we find our self engaging less in 
                    the activity for various reasons. One reason we discovered was that finding 10 other people who will play
                    at specific location and scheduled time was inconvenient since most people are living and working in different 
                    environments. Hence, we wanted to solve that problem by creating a service that connects people on demand for 
                    pickup games around their location.

                    It is estimated that more than 200 million young adults play football recreationally. However,
                    after taking to some fellow football enthusiasts we discovered that most people tend to play less
                    regularly when they grow up.  we wanted to ease that process and make people fall in love with football and other kinds of sports 
                    pick up games again and lead
                    healthy life style.
