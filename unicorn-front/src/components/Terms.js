                        <strong>The Terms of Service includes information about your legal rights and covers areas such as automatic subscription 
                        renewals, limitations of liability, resolution of disputes by mandatory arbitration rather than a judge or jury in a court of law, and a class action waiver.</strong>

                                group, you can easily start your own kuas group.
